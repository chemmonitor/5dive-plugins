# DIVE-4021 — `5dive browser`: profile-per-site auth and a deterministic executor.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS ARRANGED AROUND. The row names three structural gaps, and a
# test that only proved "the happy path prints something" would grade none of
# them. So every arm below is a MUTANT of the specific defect the design exists
# to prevent, driven through the real bin/browser as a subprocess:
#
#   gap 1 sessions die   -> T4x: a cold profile FAILS CLOSED. The mutant is an
#                           executor that finds out mid-publish and improvises.
#   gap 2 verification   -> T5x: exit status follows the OUT-OF-BAND re-read and
#                           NOT the driver. Two mutants, and the second is the
#                           dangerous one: driver-red + artifact-live must exit 0,
#                           because a "failure" there is what double-posts on retry.
#   gap 3 profiles ARE   -> T2x: a directory this seat does not own, or that is
#         credentials       group-readable, is refused rather than repaired.
#
# There is no chrome on a CI runner and this suite must not need one, so the
# probe is driven by putting a FAKE `google-chrome` first on PATH. That is not a
# test hook in the product — bin/browser has no probe override to set, and could
# not, because a way to declare a profile live without looking is the one backdoor
# this design cannot afford. The fake is exercising the real _probe.

# DIVE-4202: this harness moved here with the plugin it grades. It used to live

# of the CLI's own repo; the plugin is published from HERE now, so the test that
# reds when the plugin breaks lives with it. grading_tree.sh did not come along —

# bin/browser restore a serve, and a restore starts a REAL Xvfb whenever the fake
# is not on PATH. Nothing ever stopped it, and `_display_free` (bin/browser) keys
# on /tmp/.X11-unix/X<n> EXISTING rather than on a live pid — so every run left
# one more display AND one more socket behind, the serve arms walked further up
# the range each time, and after a few dozen runs the suite hung looking for a
# free display. Invisible in CI, where the runner is fresh.

# DIVE-4524 made the shipped driver the default, so "no FIVEDIVE_BROWSER_DRIVER"
# is no longer the interesting case; "the executor refused before it ran a step"
# is. The fixture is deliberately loaded against us: the verify URL
# (file://$TMP/slug-42.html) ALREADY HOLDS the expect string, because a permalink
# that exists is the normal case. So a `run` that reaches its out-of-band re-read
# after an executor that never opened a browser reports SUCCESS for a publish
# nobody performed — vacuous green, with a receipt. Exit 70 from the driver is
# the contract that stops it.
#
# AND THE ABSENCE HAS TO BE A FACT, NOT AN ACCIDENT OF WHERE THE CHECKOUT SITS.
# A bare require() walks node_modules up every ancestor, so on a box with a
# /tmp/node_modules/playwright-core (this one has) a worktree under /tmp made
# this arm red — the executor WAS resolvable, just not by anybody's choice.
# DIVE-4524 pinned the driver's resolution to NODE_PATH + its own package dir,
# with no ancestor walk, so the fixture is a byte-identical copy of the shipped
# driver in a directory that has neither. The copy is asserted identical, or this

#   T10g  the URL works in a DIFFERENT session -> pasted-link theft
#   T10h  the nonce is accepted from argv      -> /proc/<pid>/cmdline is not a vault
#   T10i  a wrong nonce is accepted
#   T10j  revoke leaves the ticket redeemable
#   T10c  a box missing the packages half-starts instead of saying so
#   T10k  a viewer is minted with no session binding at all
#   T10m  x11vnc/websockify/Xvfb are started with a flag that opens the box
#   T10n  the VNC server dies before the ticket it was minted for expires
#   T10o  a spent ticket still tells an attacker whether a nonce was right
#   T10p  a ticket outlives the browser it views, and redeems onto a dead port
#   T10q  a REPLAY kills the live viewer -> a hoisted refusal that is not pure
#   T10r  a missing VNC credential SPENDS the customer's one-time link
#   T10s  a link is issued onto a bridge that has not bound its port yet
#   T10t  the ticket advertises life the VNC server was never given
#
# There is no X server on a CI runner, so Xvfb/x11vnc/websockify are FAKES on
# PATH. They are not product hooks: liveness is still the real PID check in
# _serve_running, and redemption is the real sha256 compare. The only override is
# the X socket DIRECTORY, which is a path — pointing it somewhere else cannot make
# a dead display read as live.
#
# AND THE FAKES RECORD THEIR ARGV. The first version of them ran `exec sleep 300`
# and threw "$@" away, which quietly deleted a whole test surface: the property
# this design LEADS with — nothing listens off-box — lives entirely in the flags
# we pass these three programs, so with argv discarded, dropping -localhost, or
# binding websockify to 0.0.0.0, or dropping -nolisten tcp changed nothing any arm
# could see (measured: 125/0 for each). A fake that ignores argv cannot grade a
# flag. These write "$*" to a file the T10m arms below assert on, so the flags are
# MEASURED here and not merely unverified against the real programs.

# === T15 DIVE-4488: `shot` — the act half, verb one ==========================
#
# The defect each arm kills, in one line each, because "it printed a path" grades
# nothing:
#   T15a/b  a PNG of the SIGN-IN PAGE handed back as the artifact. That is the
#           dangerous failure: it is not a crash, it is evidence-shaped and a
#           grader cannot tell it from the real thing. Positive list only.
#   T15c    a CDP port reintroduced to avoid the serve cycle — it would hand every
#           seat on the box full control of a logged-in profile, which no file
#           mode can take back. Measured on the argv, not on the comment.
#   T15d    a screenshot that stops a customer's browser WHILE A PERSON is logged
#           into it through the viewer.
#   T15e    a serve that a failed render leaves stopped.
#   T15f    one profile's name vouching for another site's page (a logged-out
#           render that reads as a bug in the feature).
#   T15g    an empty/absent PNG reported as a screenshot.
#   T15j    (iteration 2) a STALE PNG from an earlier render reported as this
#           one. T15g only grades the half where --out starts empty; `-s` is
#           true for the old file, so a chrome that writes nothing passes the
#           guard and the caller is handed yesterday's page under today's URL.
#
# The fake chrome here records FULL argv and, unlike the probe fakes, honours
# --screenshot by writing a file — otherwise every arm would red on T15g's check
# and none of the others would ever run.

#
# WHAT THESE ARMS ARE MUTANTS OF:
#   T16a  the shipped driver not being wired at all — `run` dying "no executor
#         backend" on every box, which is the state this row inherited.
#   T16b  a --remote-debugging-PORT reaching the launch. CDP is full control of
#         the browser holding a human's session, and a loopback port is reachable
#         by every seat on the box — it would hand that session to a seat that
#         could never open the 0700 profile directory. The pipe has nothing to
#         reach. This is T15c's claim for the driver instead of the render.
#   T16c  a throwaway browser. An action that did not run inside the profile a
#         person logged into by hand is not the thing that was asked for.
#   T16d  a step outside the fixed vocabulary being "best-efforted" — and the
#         half that matters, the browser NOT opening before the plan is checked.
#   T16e  an uninterpolated {placeholder} typed into a real account's composer.
#   T16f  the served browser left stopped, or a person evicted from a live viewer.
#
# The executor is graded through a STUB playwright-core on NODE_PATH that records
# what it was asked to do. There is no chrome and no real playwright on a CI
# runner and this suite must not need either; the driver itself is the real one.
